# CRM Application â€“ Palantir Foundry
**Overview**
Developed a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application in Palantir Foundry that transforms fragmented datasets into unified, actionable business intelligence.
The application integrates companies, contacts, and website datasets using ontology mapping, automated ETL pipelines, and interactive workshop interfaces to deliver real-time analytics and customer insights.
Focused on data quality, automation, and customer-centric design, this project demonstrates how Foundry enables scalable, intelligent enterprise systems.

**Key Features**
**Ontology-Driven Data Modeling**: Mapped relationships between Companies, Contacts, and Websites for seamless data interlinking.

**Automated Pipelines**: Built end-to-end ETL workflows using Pipeline Builder to clean, transform, and aggregate raw data.

**Interactive CRM Dashboard**: Designed a Foundry Workshop application allowing users to explore profiles, industries, and revenue data interactively.

**Customer-Centric Insights**: Delivered enriched entity profiles for better visibility into customer data and engagement metrics.

**Data Governance & Quality**: Enforced validation, lineage tracking, and schema integrity to ensure accuracy and compliance.

**Scalable Architecture**: Configured modular, reusable data workflows to support future datasets and extensions.

**Impact & Outcomes**
